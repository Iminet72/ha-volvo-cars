# Volvo Cars Home Assistant integration

This integration provides access to your Volvo car, provided your model and region are supported by their API. Supported regions include: Europe, Middle East, and Africa.

For a complete list of supported countries, check out [Volvo's API documentation](https://developer.volvocars.com/terms-and-conditions/apis-supported-locations/). However, users have reported it does work in the US and Brazil. So even if you're not in one of the listed countries, you might still get lucky!

Now check out the features section for details on what you'll get!
