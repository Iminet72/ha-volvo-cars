#### Step 1: fill in credentials

| Password                      | The password of your Volvo developer account.                                                         |
| Vehicle Identification Number | The VIN of the car you want to add.                                                                   |
| Volvo API key                 | The generated API key in the developer account.                                                       |
| Friendly name                 | This value is used in the entity ID (volvo\_[friendly name]\_[key]). If left empty, VIN will be used. |

After submitting, a One Time Password (OTP) will be sent to your email. It's a 6 digit number.
